#### Recall Previous Word

If you find yourself thinking "Oh man seeing the word **brother** in the list makes me think of a new idea! But I can't randomly get it loaded no matter how hard I try" this feature is for you.

Just click any word from the Ideas list and it will reload the word into the words dropdown.
